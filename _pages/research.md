## Working Papers

###### "Demographic shift, consumer capital, and productivity dispersion" (JMP)
I propose a link between demographic shift and increasing heterogeneity across firms regarding revenue productivity. From data on public US firms, I find evidence of demand side effects, whereby firms in sectors whose outputs are consumed more by older households have more dispersed R&D investment and revenue productivity. Using a quantitative model, I show that when older consumers have stronger consumption habits, a rise in the share of older consumers in the economy could lead to larger divergence across firms. Through the lens of the model, the increase in the share of older consumers over the 1990-2019 period could explain half of the observed increase in revenue productivity dispersion.
